# Full Screen F8

A simple utility to remap CTRL+ALT+BREAK shortcut to the F8 key. Written in autohotkey. Enjoy :)

## Why?
In a project I had to use my MacBook to connect to a remote RDP using a Windows VM.
I wanted a nicer and faster way to press that shortcut using only one key on my Mac.

## How to get it?
This is easy, head to the [releases tab](https://github.com/giordanocardillo/fullscreen-f8/releases/latest) and download the latest exe!


## How to use it?

Run it on Windows, the program will be put in the tray notification area.

To exit just right-click the tray icon and choose 'Exit'

## Command line switches

If you don't like the tooltip at startup, just run the exe using `/q` or `-q` or `/quiet` or `--quiet`
